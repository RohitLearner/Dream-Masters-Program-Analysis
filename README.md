University admissions can be confusing and stressful. Most of the times, in order to know the status of admission it can take up a lot of time.

This repo mainly focuses on what parameters are important for a student to get into post graduate college. By the end of this repo it will be clear of what are the scores required for different tests to have better admission chances and get into a dream masters program?
